Your code failed Dafny verification with the following errors:

{errors}

Reminder - the original lemma you need to complete is:
```dafny
{incomplete_dafny_file_content}
```

Please fix these errors and provide the complete corrected Dafny file. CRITICAL:
- You MUST preserve the exact lemma signature and all `requires` clauses from the original lemma above
- You MUST keep all `ensures` clauses from the original lemma above
- Only the proof body should be modified - do NOT change the specification
- Do NOT use `assume` statements or `{:axiom}` attributes
- Add explicit triggers to quantifiers where needed

Provide the corrected code in this format:
```dafny
<COMPLETE_CORRECTED_FILE_CONTENT>
```
